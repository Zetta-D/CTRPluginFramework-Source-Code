# CTRPluginFramework-Source-Code
Hey, everybody. So here it is, as Nanquitas has decided to ruin my work... I've decided to ruin his and his friends, of course. I will regularly post here source code files of his CTRPLuginFramework library [0.5.1], in order to gradually stick a dagger in his heart. Good day lol xD
